Here we provide a description of the different classes used to build
and evaluate the RBF surrogate models. Two different
kernel functions :math:`\phi(r)` are defined in the code, the Exponential
kernel (:class:`RBF_Exponential <.utilities.kernels.exponential.RBF_Exponential>`, ,
the Spline kernel (:class:`RBF_Spline <.utilities.kernels.spline.RBF_Spline>`).

The ``fit`` method of these classes solves the system :math:`A s = F`.
In the case of RBF interpolants, the vector :math:`F` contains the values
of the function where the points have been evaluated and the matrix :math:`A`
is defined as:

.. math::
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
            \Phi & P \\
            P^T & 0.
        \end{bmatrix}

The matrix :math:`\Phi` is defined as:

.. math::
    \Phi_{i,j} = \phi(r_{i,j}),

where :math:`r_{i,j} = \left \| x^i-x^j \right\|` is the Euclidean distance
between the points :math:`x^i` and :math:`x^j`.

Once the ``fit`` method has been used to build the surrogate model, it is possible
to evaluate points using the method ``evaluate``.

If new points are generated, the


Exponential Kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Exponential Kernel is defined as follows:

.. math::
    \Phi(r) = \exp \left( -\dfrac{r^2}{2 l^2} \right),
    
where :math:`l>0` and :math:`r=\|y-x\|`, where :math:`\|\cdot\|` is the
Euclidean norm.

    :members:

Spline Kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The thin-plate spline kernel is defined as follows:

.. math::
    \Phi(r) = r^2 \log \left(r\right),

where :math:`r=\|y-x\|`, where :math:`\|\cdot\|` is the Euclidean norm.

The first derivative of the Mat√©rn Kernel with respect to the
distance is defined as:
